You can assign multiple variables in JavaScript in the same line of code:

```js
var a = 1, b = 2
console.log(a, b) // 1 2
```

<br/>
And you can also assign several variables together:

```js
var a = b = 2
console.log(b) // 2
console.log(a) // ReferenceError: a is not defined
```

<br/>
Everything seems working correctly right? What if you do this instead:

```js
function f() {
  var a = b = 2
}
f()
console.log(a)
console.log(b)
```

<br/>
What just happened? Assignment is right associative (pairs from right to left), so the next two lines of code are equivalent:

```js
var a = b = c = 2
var a = (window.b = (window.c = 2))
```
<br/>
The right most pair is like an assignment when we forget to put the var keyword.
