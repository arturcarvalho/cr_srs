# What is this?

Some rules I put together to _guide_ me writing articles and questions to said articles.

# What's the motivation?

I noticed two things:

1. I constantly interrupt coding to check my technical notebook or google something.
2. Creating questions for spaced repetition systems helps me find new perspectives into a topic I'm learning.

And that is why coderanx was made.

```js
const { articles, questions, spaced_repetition_system } = coderanx
```

# Writing articles and questions

**Define what you are writing:**

- Who will read it?
- What should the readers know after reading what you wrote?

**Use "you" as the pronoun:**

USe "you" and avoid "I", "we", "let's", and "us".

**Avoid insinuating it's easy:**

Avoid using words like "easy", "simple", "basic". In some cases "just" is also bad.
Make sure the reader doesn't question his/her abilities.

**Provide examples:**

A good example transforms an abstract concept into a concrete one. Easier to reason about.

**Provide sources and timestamps:**

Something you wrote may seem wrong or outdated. With the text's source and timestamp, you can quickly review the basis for what you wrote.

**Avoid interference:**

The words _function_ and _functional_ are similar. This may confuse you and their memories may interfere with each other. So, be aware of the interferences and try to be very clear about the differences when they appear.

**Use emotions:** People memorize

**Stick to the minimum information principle:** Try to make questions as simple as possible. Each question should teach one thing only.

**Use mnemonics:** For instance to remember between fn.apply vs fn.call, think **a** for **apply** and **array**. And **c** for **call** and **comma separated**.

**Avoid sets:** It's hard to remember sets of values, so avoid them. If you have to memorize sets, try to convert them to a sequence. But avoid sequences too.
